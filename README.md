# GlucoRAFT
GlucoRAFT uses the RAFT algorithm to run servers for interactions between the CGM users and a analytics application that displays statistics to the user about their blood glucose values that streams live to the application. 
This is an example usecase built to test my understanding of the RAFT consensus algorithm that is widely adopted today.

Here's where you can find the original RAFT paper and github.io page for your reference.
